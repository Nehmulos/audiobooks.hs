This is a WIP LEARNING PROJECT
I've got no Idea what I'm doing, but I'm doing it to get some practical
experience with haskell.

The js version can be found here: https://github.com/Nehmulos/audiobooks.js

This thing should start a http server and provide:
- an API to list existing authors and their books
- an API to play something with mplayer on the server
- an API to stream something to an (audio-tag) client
- feature creep bullshit nobody needs
- a web gui to control it all

============= How to =============
Put your files into this directory structure:
public/books/$AUTHOR/$BOOK/$CD/$TRACK.ogg

you can add covers as cover.(png/jpg/jpeg) in:
public/books/$AUTHOR/cover.png
public/books/$AUTHOR/$BOOK/cover.png
